                <p class="cs-text">Not every client sails in with a huge budget and that's just fine. With Salt Song's white label website service your agency can offer polished, seaworthy sites to small budget clients without draining your own resources.</p>

                <p class="cs-text">Passing on a low budget client might seem like tossing dead weight, but you could be sending long term value overboard. Our white label partnership lets you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer solid, affordable websites without tying up your team.</li>
                    <li>Keep clients in your harbor so when they need branding, content or campaigns they come to you.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p class="cs-title">Special Partner Pricing</p>
                <p class="cs-text">We offer exclusive agency partnership rates so you can increase your margins or pass the value to your clients and look like a damn hero. Either way, you win.</p>
                
                <p class="cs-title">What's in the Package?</p>
                <p class="cs-text">Our flagship white label service is a fully custom 5 page website starting below our public rate of $199 per month. Need us to present under your brand? No problem.
