                <h2 class="cs-title">Professional Web Design and Development Services for Small Business</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">Our most popular website service is a custom 5-page website for just $199 per month. This is the heart of our no-hassle, no-nonsense approach for small businesses.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">Your monthly price includes unlimited updates, so your site stays fresh without any added stress. Want to grow or add extra features? We offer flexible upgrades that won't sink your budget.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">Affordable doesn't mean you get less, it means you get exactly what you need without the markup.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Why Our Websites Are Better</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">At Salt Song, we build websites like ships: streamlined, sturdy, and seaworthy. No bloat. No unnecessary cargo. Just clean, handcrafted HTML sites that cut through digital waters with ease.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">Modern website platforms often try to do everything at once. In the process, they lose speed, clarity and control. Our approach skips the clutter and delivers clean, handcrafted sites that perform better.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Speed That Leaves Others in Our Wake</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">When a visitor clicks on your site you have seconds to make a good impression. A fast loading site is not a bonus, it is essential! HTML gives us the power to strip away everything that slows a site down. No bloated code, no plugin delays, just a smooth experience that loads before the user can blink.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">Increased performance is noticed and rewarded by search engines. Speed is a direct ranking factor, which means a faster site can help move your website closer to the top of the search results.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Accessibility Anchored in the Build</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">We do not bolt accessibility on at the end. We build it into the hull. HTML allows us to structure content in a way that is clear and usable for everyone from screen reader users to keyboard only navigators. We use proper headings, image descriptions and clean markup to make sure your site welcomes every visitor.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">An accessible website isn't just good design, it's good business. Accessibility makes your site easier for everyone to use and helps protect you from costly ADA compliance lawsuits. More than that: it's simply the right thing to do. Inclusive design means your website works for all visitors. That's a standard we believe every business should meet.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Clean Code Means Better SEO</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">Search engines ❤️ HTML! It's simple, fast, and easy for bots to crawl. Your content isn't hidden behind scripts or popups. We build with clean semantic markup, which gives your content the structure and clarity that search engines love. That means better visibility and a better chance of showing up when someone searches for your business.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Secure. Solid. Seaworthy.</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">HTML websites are more secure than sites that depend on plugins, themes and third party tools. There is no login screen to attack, no database to break and no plugins quietly going out of date behind the scenes.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">As platforms become outdated the sites running on them become slower, weaker and more prone to attack. HTML hasn't changed in decades. It is not going out of style and it doesn't have weaknesses to exploit.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>Built to Last</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">HTML is the foundation of the web and it's not going anywhere. By building your site this way, you're investing in something stable and future proof. Unlike platforms that rely on dozens of third-party plugins, HTML sites don't break when a service updates or a plugin fails. That means no surprise crashes, no costly upgrades and no scrambling to fix things when your site suddenly stops working.</p>
                <p class="cs-text"><h3>The Smarter Way to Set Sail</h3></p><br/>
                <p class="cs-text">At Salt Song, we believe in keeping things simple, fast, and human. HTML gives us the tools to build websites that feel good to use and stand the test of time.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">If you are ready for a site that loads fast, works for everyone, and stays steady in changing seas, give us a call and let us help chart your course.</p>
