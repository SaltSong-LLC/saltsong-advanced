**Ahoy, digital sailors!**

There’s trouble on the horizon, and it’s coming from none other than the mighty shores of data privacy. You might’ve heard the whispers drifting through the sea mist: "Google Analytics is illegal in the EU."

Wait, what? That trusty compass we've all used to chart our website traffic is suddenly banned like rum during Prohibition?

## What's Going On?

In 2022, several European data protection authorities dropped anchor on Google Analytics, ruling that it violates the GDPR. Why? Because it transfers data (like IP addresses and browser info) back to the good ol’ U.S. of A.

The issue is that this kind of data transfer might let U.S. authorities spy on EU citizens. And under the strict GDPR laws that’s a big nope.

So if your website’s based in the EU or you get traffic from EU users then using the standard version of Google Analytics might leave you sailing into stormy waters. (Gettin sued on the high seas!)

What Happens if you just ignore this?

If regulators catch wind that you're tracking EU visitors without proper consent or protection you could be fined or forced to walk the compliance plank. Also: cookie banners that say “By using this site you agree” don’t cut it anymore. That’s like offering someone a life jacket after they’ve already fallen overboard.

### What are the Alternatives?

If you want smooth sailing, here are a few privacy first analytics tools that are much easier to understand and navigate, do not collect data from your visitors and are GDPR compliant:

* [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)
* [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/)
* [Simple Analytics
  ](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/)

Please note, we do use Plausible both for ourselves and clients. The links above are NOT affiliate links and we get nothing from any of these companies if you sign up for their services.

Look, we get it. Tracking your website data is important. But so is respecting your visitors' privacy AND keeping yourself litigation free! If you want help setting sail with a privacy first setup (that still gives you the data you need) we’ve got your back.
