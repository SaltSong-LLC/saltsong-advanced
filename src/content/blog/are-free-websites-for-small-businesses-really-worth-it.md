If you've just started a small business, one of the first things you may consider is building a website. After all, you need a place online where customers can find you, learn about your services and maybe even place an order or book a service. But should you use a free website builder or is it worth paying for one?

There are a few reasons you may want to use a free website builder in the beginning. For example, you may be experimenting with your business idea and want to see if it's viable before investing too much. There is also some time and consideration that goes into website development, so you may need a temporary website or landing page while you work on your branding and service offerings.

However, once if you start building a site with Wix or Squarespace you will quickly notice that there is a learning curve that may cost you a number of hours. Additionally, there are some other pitfalls that you may not know how to avoid. One business owner told us that she tried to build her own website on Squarespace and it took her hours and she cried the whole time! 

We think your website should be a source of pride, not a cause for tears! So lets break down some of the reasons that a "free" website builder may not be the best option for your business in the long term.

## The Cons of Free Websites for Small Businesses

**Unprofessional Branding**

Free website builders often place their branding on your site. Having something like “Powered by Wix” at the bottom of your site can make your business look less professional to potential customers.

Additionally, if you have no design experience your website may end up looking cluttered, off-brand or be difficult to navigate. It will almost certainly have some serious [accessibility](https://saltsongwebdesign.com/blog/ada-compliance/) problems. User experience and mobile responsiveness are also really important considerations that a professional would take care to develop. All of these things can turn visitors away before they even learn what you offer. First impressions matter!

**Limited Features and Customization**

Free websites generally have serious limitations. Not only in the design, but also functionally. You may not be able to add e-commerce tools, booking systems, contact forms or even your have your own domain. You're also not going to have many design or SEO options and those things become very important later.

Even if you do find an excellent free website building platform, there is a learning curve. Many people (including website professionals) find drag and drop web building tools frustrating and spend hours trying to get the results they want to no avail. That is time that should be spent building your business instead of trying to learn which website building platform you think is most user friendly.

**No Control Over Ads**

Many free website platforms display ads on your site. These are ads that you don’t control and don’t earn money from! They can also distract your customers or make you seem sketchy. There is also no guarantee these platforms aren't selling you out to competitors. Imagine doing all the work to get a prospect to your website only to have them bombarded with a competitor ad that leads to your competitor!

You can only fully control your website if you have full ownership over it. We touch briefly on the pitfalls of using "free tools" in this post about [google analytics spying on your website visitors](https://saltsongwebdesign.com/blog/google-may-be-sinking-you/) and using that information to advertise to them in the future. Because of this, all free services should be regarded with caution. Selling your client's data can lead to them being redirected to competitor websites and result in you losing sales that you worked for.

**Poor SEO Performance**

Free websites tend to rank lower in search engine results. Drag and drop builders create slow, bloated code that is hard for search engines to interpret. Google favors fast, secure and well-optimized websites. Not one free plan offers a website that will perform well in search engines and they are generally also very slow because of the bloated code. 

Google also understands that these are free websites and it will not take your site as seriously as it would a paid website that someone has put effort into. If anyone can throw it together then chances are that it's not very trustworthy and maybe not even permanent. It is much easier for search engines to take your site seriously if you are taking it seriously by purchasing a domain name and putting effort into development.

Clients can certainly tell the difference between a great website development and something you just threw together in a few spare hours over the weekend. Search engine bots can also tell. 

**You Don’t Own the Platform**

If you're using a free builder you don’t own your website. If the platform shuts down or changes its terms then you could lose your website or be forced to upgrade and start paying for it. 

What's worse is businesses that operate only from a social media page like Facebook or a google listing. These platforms can shut you down at any time and with very little reason or justification. If they do so you have very few options to appeal the decision and you will certainly lose access to your customer list while the problem gets sorted out. (This often takes months and in some cases the page will never be reinstated.)

## Are Free Websites Really Worth It?

If you're just starting out, testing an idea or need a basic online presence fast, a free website can absolutely serve you in the short term. 

However, if you are serious about growing your business then investing in a professional website is worth every penny. A custom domain, a polished design, SEO tools and full control over your content can make a huge difference in how customers find and trust you.

## Affordable Alternatives to Free Websites

A free website is never going to be a good long-term solution for most small businesses. As your business grows your website will need to grow with it. Reputable web developers have spent their careers building their craft. There are many things that should be considered when building a website that the average business owner doesn't have time to learn. This is why you should only trust a professional to build you a website. Just as you would only call a plumber for a broken toilet or use a reputable contractor to remodel your kitchen.

If you're ready to level up with your small business, consider working with a team that specializes in affordable, fully managed website solutions for small businesses. You’ll save time, look professional and actually get found online.
