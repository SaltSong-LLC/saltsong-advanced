If you've ever tried to build your own website, you've probably run into the jungle of modern website tools: page builders, pre-made themes, plugins and add ons for everything.

At first they seem helpful. But before long you're buried in a tangled mess of updates, login issues, conflicting plugins and bloated pages that load slowly.

After years of headaches, updates and slow running sites, we've decided to leave all that behind. And we think you should, too!

### What’s the Problem with Plugins, Themes, and Builders?

Plugins are little bits of code that add features to your site. They’re often built by third parties and not all of them are secure or reliable. Additionally, the developer who built the plugin may not be very good or he may disappear forever when he loses interest in the work. Once the plugin fails, it could bring down your entire website. At the very least, you will be stuck paying a developer to install a new plugin that could cause the same issue at any point in the future. And most modern websites are built with dozens of plug-ins!

Themes can look pretty on the surface but they are built for sale. That means they're trying appeal to a wide audience who may have multiple uses for it. So developers often pack them with a ton of features and excess code that you will likely never use. This will slow the site down and make it harder to manage in the future.

Builders (like WordPress or Wix) give you drag-and-drop tools. If you have attempted to use these tools on your own, you know that there is a learning curve. Additionally, your drag and drop editor is behind the scenes attempting to translate all of this into code... and they're not very good at it. They generate bloated messy code that hurt your site’s speed, SEO and usability. It also makes updates extremely difficult to make in the future. In short, it's a lot of work for a subpar product.

These tools are like stuffing a boat with cargo you don’t need. Sure, it floats—for now. But it’s heavy, fragile, and prone to sinking when the weather changes.

### The Simpler, Smarter Way to Build a Website

 - Faster load times
 - Better SEO
