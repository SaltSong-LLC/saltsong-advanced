In the vast ocean of digital tools, it's tempting to use free services. Many developers install tools like Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager by default. We did this ourselves for many years. They're easy to use, widely supported and offer valuable insights into your site's traffic.

But beware, there's a current beneath the surface that's easy to miss. Google Analytics is not free because you're paying with your customer's data. You may not care about your visitors data until you learn how Google will use that data to give an advantage to your competitor. 

## When You Let Google Onboard, They Join the Voyage

Let's say a prospective customer visits your website and they're interested in your state of the art Seagull Translator. They decide not to purchase today but they plan to. 

If you're running Google Analytics then Google knows they were there. Google will share this data but it's not just you watching from the crow's nest. Google is charting your visitors' every move. And they will now sell your hard earned lead to the highest bidder.

### Why Does Google Want That Data?

Google didn't make it's fortune by giving away free tools to business owners. It sells targeted advertising. They use that data to help advertisers target ads to your visitors. Your website helps feed that system. 

Now your competitor who sells a Seagull Translator knockoff pays for targeted advertising from Google. The first people those ads will target are people who have visited your site. You have sold a product, but you've done it for your competitor because you shared your lead with Google.

What is a Seagull Translator going for nowadays? Whatever the cost of that sale, that's how much you've just paid for your "free" analytics!

### Google Analytics Alternative

At Salt Song we value privacy, data sovereignty and keeping third parties out of our harbor. Every tool used on your website should serve your mission. That's why we would never work with someone who competes with our client and that's why we don't advise our clients to use Google Analytics. It's a conflict of interest.

Instead, we use a paid analytics alternative with no cookies that won't slow your site down or share your customer's data. Our tools are GDPR compliant so you don't need one of those cookie popups. Instead of a frustrating and hard to understand Google dashboard, you receive a monthly report that's easy to read for a human.

Are you ready to ditch Google Analytics and get a better website? Give us a call today.
