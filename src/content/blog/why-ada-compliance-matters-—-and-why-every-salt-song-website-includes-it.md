At Salt Song, we don’t just build websites we build *smarter* websites. That means every site we create is designed to be ADA compliant from the start. But what does that actually mean and why is it worth the investment?

### What Is ADA Compliance?

An ADA compliant website ensures that people with disabilities, including those who use screen readers, voice commands, or keyboard navigation can access and use your website effectively. This isn’t just about good design it is about equal access.

In the U.S., laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require digital experiences to be accessible and many businesses have faced costly lawsuits for failing to meet these standards. Considering that 1 in 4 Americans lives with a disability, accessibility is not just a legal or financial concern. It is about respecting and welcoming a significant portion of your potential audience.

### Why Most Websites Miss the Mark

Unfortunately, most websites today are not accessible. Many developers still do not prioritize ADA compliance during the design process. To patch these issues later, some businesses turn to third-party overlay tools like AccessiBe or UserWay. These services typically start at about $60 per month. In recent years these tools have become controversial and in some cases they have actually triggered lawsuits for making accessibility worse.

Leading accessibility experts and members of the disabled community widely agree that overlays don not create accessible websites. In some cases, they make it even more difficult to access the website.

### How We Do It Differently

At Salt Song, we have loved ones who struggle with disabilities and we value inclusivity. We believe the smartest and most cost effective way to handle accessibility is to build it in from the beginning. That’s why every Salt Song website is built using ADA best practices. No costly add-ons and no leaving anyone out.

And here’s the bonus: accessibility best practices overlap with good web development! Clean and well structured code isn’t just easier for screen readers, it’s also easier for search engines to understand. That means our websites aren’t just inclusive, they are optimized for performance, speed, and visibility.

### What You Get with a Salt Song Website

It's a win-win for everyone and that's what makes our websites smarter.
